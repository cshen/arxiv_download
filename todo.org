* tests
** TODO print directory where article was downloaded to
** TODO what if no/false directory is given?

* to add/change
** DONE only one function (replace show with get but ask to download) --> changed later on...
   CLOSED: [2020-12-12 Sat 19:38]
** DONE flags for 'get':
   CLOSED: [2021-01-05 Tue 10:55]
*** DONE --dir (set default dir); also show default directory in help
    CLOSED: [2020-12-19 Sat 22:00]
    Note: instead introduced a set command.
*** DONE get -dir (to download to specified directory)
    CLOSED: [2020-12-15 Tue 15:47]
*** DONE -o (open file after download) (THINK ABOUT OPTION)
    CLOSED: [2020-12-15 Tue 15:15]
*** abandoned flags (moved to other commands etc.)
**** -a show abstract

**** -d download directly (REALLY NEEDED? --> decided against it for now)

** TODO -bib get bib-entry
*** DONE remove ax_id from title
    CLOSED: [2020-12-21 Mon 21:28]
*** DONE curly braces around capital letters/words
    CLOSED: [2020-12-27 Sun 17:05]
*** TODO get the arxiv subject? --> mostly relevant if we want different folders for different subjects
*** DONE meaningful tags? (somewhat too long atm but hopefully recognizable) (note: we assume that the user uses a tex editor with auto-completion for keys...)
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 13:03]
*** DONE how to deal with many authors?!? (also ok for now...)
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 13:05]
*** DONE also first names! --> how does bibtex deal with many authors (> 5?) (just `contract' the short authors' name)
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 12:05]
*** DONE how to deal with {} in title?!
    CLOSED: [2020-12-27 Sun 17:05]
** flags for 'set':
*** TODO [#A] set bibtex-file where bibtex-entry is appended to.
** TODO [#A] make it work for other OS (problem: file name...)
** TODO [#A] in retrieve.py: necessary to use zfill?
** DONE [#A] BUG: bibtex entry for three authors...
   CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 21:00]
** TODO [#A] check special characters in bib-keys and titles (also remove 'and', 'or' etc.?); 'the' correctly removed? (2011.01235)
** TODO [#A] 'arxiv_script AX_ID bib' alone does not work...
** DONE [#A] design decision: it seems more intuitive to use `show' instead of 'get -a'.
   CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 21:41]
** DONE [#A] another design decision: should we remove 'get' altogether? (seems to only complicate things with Click... however, still restructured the script)
   CLOSED: [2021-01-02 Sat 21:42]
** DONE [#A] check if default_directory == '' is detected.
   CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 11:09]
** DONE [#A] think about what we show before appending a bibtex-entry; related: always ask user before downloading/appending?
   CLOSED: [2021-01-06 Wed 11:01]

** TODO [#B] upload to github!
** TODO [#B] write some short documentation: what do the different .py-files do etc.
** TODO [#B] rename retrieve.py in axs.py (--> new install of script?)
** TODO [#B] zblatt
** TODO [#B] instead of year (for an article) print release date?! (year is clear from identifier...)
** TODO [#B] add minor subjects?

** TODO [#B] space between entries necessary? (it's not too bad without because of the curly braces)


** TODO [#C] show recent, today in arxiv (how to browse?!?)
** TODO [#C] design decision: option to download in other directories (e.g. recognize different arXiv subjects)
