* tests
** TODO print directory where article was downloaded to
** TODO what if no/false directory is given?

* to add/change
** DONE only one function (replace show with get but ask to download)
   CLOSED: [2020-12-12 Sat 19:38]
** TODO flags for 'get':
*** DONE --dir (set default dir); also show default directory in help
    CLOSED: [2020-12-19 Sat 22:00]
    Note: instead introduced a set command.
*** DONE get -dir (to download to specified directory)
    CLOSED: [2020-12-15 Tue 15:47]
*** DONE -o (open file after download) (THINK ABOUT OPTION)
    CLOSED: [2020-12-15 Tue 15:15]
*** DONE -a show abstract
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 12:08]
*** DONE -d download directly (REALLY NEEDED? --> decided against it for now)
    CLOSED: [2020-12-21 Mon 21:29]
*** DONE -bib get bib-entry
    CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 13:05]
**** DONE remove ax_id from title
     CLOSED: [2020-12-21 Mon 21:28]
**** DONE curly braces around capital letters/words
     CLOSED: [2020-12-27 Sun 17:05]
**** TODO get the arxiv subject? --> mostly relevant if we want different folders for different subjects
**** DONE meaningful tags? (somewhat too long atm but hopefully recognizable) (note: we assume that the user uses a tex editor with auto-completion for keys...)
     CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 13:03]
**** DONE how to deal with many authors?!? (also ok for now...)
     CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 13:05]
**** DONE also first names! --> how does bibtex deal with many authors (> 5?) (just `contract' the short authors' name)
     CLOSED: [2021-01-01 Fri 12:05]
**** DONE how to deal with {} in title?!
     CLOSED: [2020-12-27 Sun 17:05]
**** TODO still need to take care of some other special chars...
** flags for 'set':
*** TODO [#A] set bibtex-file where bibtex-entry is appended to.
** TODO [#A] make it work for other OS (problem: file name...)
** TODO [#A] design decision: it seems more intuitive to use `show' instead of 'get -a' ...
** TODO [#A] another design decision: should we remove 'get' altogether?
** TODO [#A] in retrieve.py: necessary to use zfill?
** TODO [#A] check if default_directory == '' is detected.
** TODO [#A] check special characters in bib-keys and titles

** TODO [#B] upload to github!
** TODO [#B] write some short documentation: what do the different .py-files do etc.
** TODO [#B] rename retrieve.py in axs.py (--> new install of script?)
** TODO [#B] zblatt

** TODO [#C] show recent, today in arxiv (how to browse?!?)
** TODO [#C] design decision: option to download in other directories (e.g. recognize different arXiv subjects)
